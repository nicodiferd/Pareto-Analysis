# Parento Analysis Findings

This Project is a single use case project built to break down real data about the users who are using flora and to hopefully build a pareto chart around the following subjects:

1. What are the most common types of prompts that users are sending to flora on first go?
2. What insights show up consistently across users and mulitple prompts?
3. Model counts? (count how many prompts were asked given the model used - looking to create a visual showing the distrubution of models used)
4. What are the main topics of consideration? rough analysis

## Rough Background of Senior Project 

### Project Information

**Project Number:** Project 4
**Proposal:** BLOOM-02: Designing AI Agentic Structures for SDLC Project Management
**Sponsor:** Bloomfilter AI
**Sponsor Contact:** Andrew Wolfe & Sam Aborne
- andrew@bloomfilter.ai
- sam.aborne@bloomfilter.ai

**Anticipated Section:** TBD
**NDA/IP:** Yes
**Citizenship Requirement:** No
**Project Field:** IE

### Background

Bloomfilter AI is developing Flora, an agentic AI project manager/scrum master designed to guide teams through software development. Unlike traditional SaaS tools, Flora acts as a "digital co-worker," combining SDLC data, predictive analytics, and multi-agent architectures to improve forecasting, reporting, and decision-making.

The key challenge lies not just in technical capability but in adoption: most AI projects fail due to lack of structured change management and unclear expectations of what the AI "role" should be.

### Challenge

Students will define the capabilities, interactions, and characteristics required for an AI agent to effectively serve as a digital twin of a human project manager or scrum master. The focus will be on both the technical capabilities (e.g., forecasting, context handling, multi-agent scaling) and the human interaction model (e.g., personality, communication style, human-in-the-loop protocols).

### Specific Goals

- Conduct a literature review on AI agentic structures, digital twins, and adoption challenges in enterprise AI
- Benchmark emerging competitors (AI project managers, agentic IE tools) to compare features and approaches
- Define the "digital job description" for Flora: what tasks, behaviors, and interactions are essential for trust and adoption
- Propose personality and communication archetypes (e.g., concierge vs. drill sergeant) and test user resonance
- Map change management requirements for successful adoption of Flora in client organizations

### Recommended Skills

- Industrial Engineering and organizational change management
- Knowledge of agile project management and Scrum practices
- AI/ML fundamentals, particularly multi-agent structures
- Human-computer interaction (HCI) and UX research
- Strong analytical and communication skills
